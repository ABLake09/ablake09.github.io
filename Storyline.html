<h2>Full Story</h2>
<p>Alexandra also known as Alexa and her single dad Burt lived in a small town named VeeVille. Burt had a job as a scientist, so was working a lot in his lab. Alexa always wanted to see what her dad was working, but was told she was too young. </p>
<p>On Alexa’s tenth birthday, she got art supplies and grew an interest in drawing. She enjoyed creating characters, her favorite was Pencil Dude. Burt had just finished his project he had been working on for the past few years. Alexa’s curiosity only grew and asked her dad again if she could see it. Burt could no longer say that Alexa was too young so he made a deal. Alexa would be able to see the creation if she drew Burt a photo of Pencil Dude. She quickly drew the best drawing of Pencil Dude and rushed to her dad’s lab.</p>
<p>When Alexa got to the lab she dropped everything out of shock. Including the drawing of Pencil Dude in a mysterious liquid. Burt had made a pizza making robot! Burt and Alexa played around with the robot until Alexa’s bedtime. After putting Alexa to bed Burt went back to the lab to clean up. As he was cleaning he did a test and figured out there were harmful chemicals in the lab. In fear it would spread throughout the house Burt and Alexa moved in with Burt’s parents. </p>
<p>A few months later the liquid Pencil Dude was dropped into turned him to life! He was about 4 feet tall and looked like he came straight from a cartoon. Pencil Dude surprisingly adapted to the town of VeeVille quickly. He was always helping others out as much as he could. Even though they were frightened at first the people of VeeVille warmed up to Pencil Dude eventually. After a few years of living in Veeville, Pencil Dude was elected as mayor of VeeVille. </p>
