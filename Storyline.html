      <p>Alexandra and her single dad Burt live in the small town of VeeVille. Burt is a scientist and is always
        working a lot in his basement labratory. Alexandra always wants to see what her dad is creating but is told
        she is too young. </p>
      <p>On Alexandra’s 10th birthday, she was given the gift of new art supplies and grew her interest in drawing even more. 
        She enjoyed creating characters and her favorite was Pencil Dude. Burt had just finished his project he had been working on for the past
        few years. Alexandra’s curiosity only grew and she asked her dad again if she could see it. Burt could no longer say
        that she was too young; so he made a deal. She would be allowed to see the creation if she drew a photo of
        Pencil Dude just for him. She quickly drew the best drawing of Pencil Dude and rushed to the lab.</p>
      <p>When she got to the lab it was revealed that her dad had created a pizza making robot! Alexandra was so in shock that 
        she dropped everything including the drawing of Pencil Dude. Burt and Alexandra played around with the robot until bedtime. 
        After putting Alexandra to bed Burt went back to the lab to clean up. As he was cleaning he realized a mysterious liquid had
        been knocked over and spilled. The drawing of Pencil Dude was sitting in the liquid. He did some tests and decdied it was a 
        harmful chemical. In fear it would spread throughout the house he decided they would need to
        move in with Burt’s parents a few towns over. </p>
      <p>Months went by and the liquid Pencil Dude was dropped in ended up turning him into real life! He was 4 feet tall and
        looked like he came straight from a cartoon. Pencil Dude surprisingly adapted to the town of VeeVille quickly.
        He was always helping others out as much as he could. Even though they were frightened at first the people of
        VeeVille warmed up to Pencil Dude eventually. After a few years and many good works later, Pencil Dude was elected mayor. </p>
